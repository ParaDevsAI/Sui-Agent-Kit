Sui Agent Kit 🤖🌊 - Your Gateway to Automated DeFi on Navi Protocol
Sui Overflow 2025 Submission - Infrastructure & Tooling Track

The Sui Agent Kit was born from a passion to simplify DeFi development on the Sui blockchain and to empower builders like you for the Sui Overflow 2025 Hackathon!

We believe that interacting with powerful DeFi protocols shouldn't be a complex ordeal. This kit is our answer: a robust, agent-friendly toolkit that abstracts the intricacies of the Navi Protocol SDK, exposing its rich functionalities as a set of intuitive "tools" through the Model-Context Protocol (MCP).

Our mission is to provide the foundational infrastructure that enables developers to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy sophisticated DeFi applications, automation scripts, and AI-powered agents on Sui, with a special focus on leveraging the deep liquidity and features of the Navi Protocol.

Why Sui Agent Kit? The Hackathon Edge 🚀
If you're participating in the Sui Overflow 2025 Hackathon, the Sui Agent Kit is designed to give you a significant advantage:

🌟 Dominate the Infrastructure & Tooling Track: This kit is infrastructure! Showcase a powerful tool that lowers the barrier to entry for Navi Protocol integration and enables a new wave of automated DeFi applications.
🚀 Accelerate Your DeFi & AI Projects: Building for the DeFi or AI tracks? Integrate complex Navi operations (lending, borrowing, swaps, liquid staking) with just a few tool calls. Focus on your unique application logic, not SDK boilerplate.
🤖 Build Smarter Agents: The MCP-based architecture is perfect for creating intelligent agents that can manage portfolios, execute DeFi strategies, or provide automated financial services on Sui.
💡 Innovate with Ease: Quickly experiment with novel DeFi strategies by scripting interactions with Navi Protocol.
🛠️ Focus on Value: Spend less time wrestling with SDKs and more time building the features that will impress the judges.
What is the Sui Agent Kit?
The Sui Agent Kit is a Node.js server application built with TypeScript. It acts as a bridge, translating simple MCP tool calls into direct interactions with the Navi Protocol on the Sui network
